# Work in progress

check [SETUP](./SETUP.md) for local development

currently testing on [Cyclic.sh](https://app.cyclic.sh/#/join/iamrony777) serverless infrastructure. v1 required a server but i want to make v3 fully serverless. Cloudflare blocks requests made from vercel's serverless instances

check [deployments](/deployments) -> `cyclic:dev`
